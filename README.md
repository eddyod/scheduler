# Scheduler

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.3.

This is an application that will keep track of schedules for employees
at different business locations. I created this app for my brother who
runs an ESL placement agency in Jakarta. There are lots of applictions
out there that do the same thing, but of course they all cost
something or they don't have the specific functionality.

There is a live demo of this project at:

It is buggy and the data gets wiped out often, so don't put anything
serious in it.
